Arduino hardware and software implications solve many of society's current problems. For example, this project solves the solution of remotely controlling a device's Spotify activity using Spotify API, in the case where voice recognition or the playing device is not nearby. Included are other applications such as turning a LED light on, linking Bluetooth and WIFI connections, and a Ping Pong game.
